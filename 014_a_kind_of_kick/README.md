# A kind of kick

Alright, let's put the pitch and amp envelopes together. A digital kick is
roughly:

* fast downward pitching at the start to product a click
* slow downward pitching for the decay
* an envelope that makes it sound like a drum

I'll use the "saw" type synth (which I think is really a triangle) because it
has some harmonics to it. It'll give it a bit more definition.

I'm not worried about getting a particularly nice kick here. I just want to
combine the amp envelope and pitch envelope techniques to produce a slightly
more useful sound.

## Notes

That was super easy. Setting up the CDP commands was a piece of cake. I spent
most of my time tweaking the envelopes.

At first I thought that it's a bit absurd to create basic drum sounds this way.
But I had a couple new thoughts:

1. This is how they would have done it in the old days. If you had a computer
with CDP, and wanted to generate a digital kick drum, this is how you would do
it, right? Or at least something close to it...

2. There's something to be said for having a single, unified interface for
creating sounds. I created a drum sound by editing text files! And I could
create other kinds of files too.

In fact, I think I will. There are two other three other sounds I want to
generate: a lead, a bass, and a pad.
