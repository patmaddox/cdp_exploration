# Simple lead

I want a fairly straightforward lead sound that is:

1. Slightly detuned triangle oscillators
2. Quick attack, moderate decay, pretty fast release
3. Vibrato. Delayed vibrato would be awesome...

Let's do this!

## Notes

That also went really well. I'm at least understanding the basics of this
system. And I really think there's immense power in describing sounds this way.
I have obviously not scratched the surface with this and could probably spend
the rest of my life working with this system. But I have to say that I love
describing sounds with text. It keeps me focused. I'm not distracted by all the
options in a synth or DAW. I'm just making sounds.

Now of course there's nothing inherent about a synth or DAW that prevents me
from being focused. It's just that I find this approach incredibly interesting.
And the single interface (plain text) for applying all these processes is just
fascinating.

I'm also imagining down the road, I can create pseudo-randomized sounds by
combining scripts. Imagine building a synth â€“ it has an amp envelope, filter
envelope, pitch envelope, and oscillators. Well these are all processes. And I
could design breakpoint files for each different module, and select them at
random. Or just build stuff quickly. That's for an experiment down the road :)
