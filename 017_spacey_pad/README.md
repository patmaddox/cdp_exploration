# Spacey pad

And now for my crowning achievement thus far... a pad!

I'll use all the techniques I've built up so far, plus add something new:
spacial effects.

1. Oscillators
2. Filter envelope
3. Amp envelope
4. Delay and/or reverb

## Notes

That was also pretty simple. But I'm bummed that there's no `roomverb` in my
installation.

But it's not a huge deal. This reverb sounds just fine.
