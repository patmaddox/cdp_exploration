# Envelope decay

This one should be pretty simple. Start with a sound file, and decay it to 0.
It's kind of a pluck I guess.

## Notes

I would really like to find a better way of generating synth tones... meaning
using a midi note value rather than frequencies.

Curtail works WAY better than attack. At least for my regular usage. It makes
more sense - you start off with a sound that is at its max amplitude, and then
decay it down to nothing.

I would like to be able to fade in an attack though... and decay to a particular
value rather than nothing. Basically â€“ how would I create an AHDSR envelope?
