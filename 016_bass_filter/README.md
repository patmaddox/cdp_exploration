# Bass filter

I admit this is where I'm a bit nervous. I want to make a simple sawtooth bass
with a filter envelope. I don't know how to do a filter envelope. But I know how
to do a filter, and I know how to make breakpoint files...

1. Sawtooth wave
2. Filter cutoff envelope
3. Amp envelope

## Notes

That turned out to be simpler than I expected. Which is a recurring theme :)
