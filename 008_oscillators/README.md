# Oscillators

CDP is a set of sound manipulation tools... but it has some basic synthesis
tools. I'll create a sample that I can use for further manipulation.

Let's mix two sine waves a fifth apart...

## Notes

I'm using this [note to frequency
chart](http://subsynth.sourceforge.net/midinote2freq.html) to determine which
frequencies to use. I bet there's a better way to go about it... or at least
a CDP way. That'll be for a later experiment.

Also, I figured synthesizing a tone would be pretty easy, so that's why I
decided to go with multiple tones and mix them!

Hrm I wonder if there'd be a programmatic way to confirm the two frequencies in
this file... in any case, I viewed it through a frequency analyzer and it
clearly shows the C and G.

And to answer my question: of COURSE there's a way to find the frequencies -
that's exactly what the analyzer is doing! I just don't know how to do it... yet :)
