# Unison stack

Big synth sounds! Let's stack up some waveforms...

## Notes

It's not exactly a huge fat sound, but it has some movement to it.

One thing about these experiments is that I think I'm starting to hear the
digital sound a bit more. I don't think this stacked sawtooth sounds very much
like what I'd get out of a u-he synth, for example.
