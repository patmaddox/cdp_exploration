# Envelope attack

CDP has a function called `ENVEL ATTACK` which appears to create an attack and
decay stage. Let's see if I can shape an oscillator a bit more.

## Notes

That worked pretty well. It's a bit weird because I have to start off with a
really quiet sound so that I can bump up the attack. I wonder if there's a
corresponding `envel decay` that will let me set up a decay envelope? Hrm I
guess it's called `envel curtail`.
