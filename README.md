I'm exploring CDP. This repo contains my experiments.

The basic workflow I'd like to try is:

1. Write a script to generate / process some sound
2. Generate the sound
3. If I like it, keep the script

I want this process to be extremely fast. Not sure how I can accomplish it
yet...

# Conventions

Run each experiment from their own directory. Otherwise stuff won't work
(thanks bash!)

# Nifty stuff

* Create a new experiment with `new_experiment.sh`
* Cleanup generated files with `cleanup.sh`
