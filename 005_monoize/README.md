# Monoize

CDP does not support spectral analysis on stereo files. So for this experiment,
I'll convert a stereo file to mono before doing the analysis.

I've taken the src file from `001_basics` and loaded it into a wave editor,
where I duplicated the channels and reversed the right channel. This gives me a
stereo file where the two channels differ from one another.
