# Stereo trick

In `005_monoize` I created a stereo file in a wave editor. But I'm sure I can
do that with CDP! Here's the process:

1. Duplicate the mono file
2. Reverse one channel
3. Combine the channels

If I use the source file from `001_basic` to produce this, the output should
be identical to the one from `005_monoize`. Let's give it a shot!

## Notes

Initially I used `md5` to compare the resulting files, but they were different.
I don't know why! I looked at the CDP documentation and discovered a tool
called `sndinfo diff` that does what I want – it compares the audio content
of the two files.

My best guess as to why `md5` failed is that they have different header
information, being generated by different programs. But that's just a wild
guess. Definitely something to investigate down the road.

Additionally, I thought I would need to duplicate the mono file (step 1 above).
It turns out that the reverse command (which is called `modify radical 1` -
rad!) generates a file. Which makes sense – CDP is designed to create files,
not modify existing ones. So it saved me a step. All I had to do was reverse
the file and give it the desired outfile name.
