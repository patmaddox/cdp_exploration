I've got a basic infrastructure that I'm happy with. I can create new
experiments pretty easily, and I've got a convention for where to run
projects (in their own directories).

We'll see if more stuff crops up as I continue on, but I think I'm in a good
place to really explore CDP...

I created experiment 006 before 005... on accident. I initially created
`005_stereo_analysis` but as I started working on it, I realized that I was
taking too big of a step. So I renamed it to `006_stereo_analysis` and created
`005_monoize` to work on first. And it went really nicely!

I still think `006_stereo_analysis` is a bit bigger than I'd normally like, but
I'm feeling pretty confident right now...

When I create a new experiment, I build it up one line at a time. I make sure
that works, and then I move on to the next line. It's TDD but without the
automated framework!

When my experiment `007_stereo_trick` didn't go as expected, I browsed through
the CDP manual and found something incredibly useful. Sometimes you learn the
most when things go wrong...
