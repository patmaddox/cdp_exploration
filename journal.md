I've got a basic infrastructure that I'm happy with. I can create new
experiments pretty easily, and I've got a convention for where to run
projects (in their own directories).

We'll see if more stuff crops up as I continue on, but I think I'm in a good
place to really explore CDP...

----

I created experiment 006 before 005... on accident. I initially created
`005_stereo_analysis` but as I started working on it, I realized that I was
taking too big of a step. So I renamed it to `006_stereo_analysis` and created
`005_monoize` to work on first. And it went really nicely!

I still think `006_stereo_analysis` is a bit bigger than I'd normally like, but
I'm feeling pretty confident right now...

----

When I create a new experiment, I build it up one line at a time. I make sure
that works, and then I move on to the next line. It's TDD but without the
automated framework!

----

When my experiment `007_stereo_trick` didn't go as expected, I browsed through
the CDP manual and found something incredibly useful. Sometimes you learn the
most when things go wrong...

----

I've got some ideas for more experiments that I could run... but I think I want
to read some of the documentation to get a better feel for what's available to
me. That'll guide my experiments a bit more.

But here are a couple things I'm thinking of:

1. Pitch bend
2. Filtered noise sweep
3. Rhythmic sequencing

----

I've got the hang of making basic sounds. Now I think it's up to me to explore
CDP's different functionality and see what I can do with it.

I'm also interested in composable sounds. Taking a variety of envelope
properties and transformations and combining them to create interesting new
sounds. Which gives me an idea...
