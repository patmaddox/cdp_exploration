# Coming full circle

The basis for this experiment is simple: I've figured out how to do some basic
processing on samples. I applied envelopes to simple waveforms, but there's
nothing special about them â€“ I can use more complex waveforms as well.

This experiment combines what I've done so far, to make a hybrid sound. I'll
use:

* the blurred babbling brook sound from `004_blur`
* the pad envelope and reverb from `017_spacey_pad`

Let's see what I get from that!

## Notes

It's not an amazing sound, but...

* it's different from anything I have so far
* it's different from anything I'd come up with myself
* it took me less than a minute!! of copying and pasting
