# Share src

Testing how to load a src file from the previous experiment. It's pretty
annoying.

But I discovered that I can't execute my first experiment from the top-level...

So the question is: do I spend any more time on infrastructure? Or set a
convention for these first experiments and explore CDP more? I think that
sounds a lot more appealing...
